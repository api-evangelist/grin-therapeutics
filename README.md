<!-- API-EVANGELIST-PROVENANCE:BEGIN -->
> ### About this repository
>
> **This is not our API.** This repository is an independent, third-party profile of a company's
> **publicly available** API surface, maintained by [API Evangelist](https://apievangelist.com).
> API Evangelist does not operate, host, resell, or support this company's APIs, and is not
> affiliated with or endorsed by the company unless stated on the profile.
>
> **Where the information came from.** Everything here is assembled from material a member of the
> public can reach with a browser and no credentials — the company's own website, developer portal
> and documentation, the specifications it publishes for public use (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema,
> `apis.json`, `llms.txt` and similar), its public repositories, and its public status, pricing and
> changelog pages. **Nothing here is obtained by breaching a system, defeating an access control, or
> using credentials of any kind.**
>
> **The rating is an independent assessment.** The Kin Score and Agent Readiness rating are
> independently calculated scores of a company's *public* API artifacts, produced by API Evangelist
> against a published rubric. They are not certifications, endorsements, security assessments, or
> audits, and they score published artifacts — not the quality, safety, or security of the software.
>
> **Corrections, re-scores, and removal are free.** No partnership, contract, or purchase is
> required, and you do not need to justify the request.
>
> - **Something wrong?** Open an issue on this repository, or email
>   [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com).
> - **Published something new?** Ask for a re-score and we will re-run the rating.
> - **Want the listing taken down?** Say so and we will honor it. The profile is reduced to your
>   company name, a factual description, and a link to your own site, and the company is recorded as
>   **unrated** — never scored zero for having asked.
>
> **Response times.** Acknowledgement within **one business day**; removal or restriction within
> **two business days**; corrections and re-scores within **five business days**.
>
> **Not from the company, and here with a question?** You are welcome here — we would rather be the
> front line and point you the right way than have a good report go nowhere. What this repository
> can answer is narrow, though, so it is worth knowing who you are actually looking for:
>
> - **A question about how the API works, an account, billing, or a bug in the service** — that is
>   the company's own support, not us. We profile this API; we do not operate it and cannot see
>   your account.
> - **A bug in an open-source project we only catalog** — file it on that project's own repository.
>   This has happened with a real and correct bug report that reached us instead of the people who
>   could fix it, which helped nobody.
> - **Anything about this listing itself** — the description, the tags, the rating, a missing or
>   wrong artifact — is ours. Open an issue here.
> - **Not sure, or something general about API Evangelist or APIs.io** — open an issue on the
>   [APIs.io Inbox](https://github.com/api-search/inbox) and we will route it.
>
> **This repository contains no software, and we will never ask you to download anything.** There is
> no build, release, installer, or binary here — only text and machine-readable API descriptions, so
> there is nothing here that can be "corrupt" or need "repairing". Any issue, comment, or email
> claiming otherwise and offering a download link is not from us and is hostile. Do not follow the
> link; it is a lure. Report it to GitHub and, if you like, tell us at
> [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com) so we can take it down.
>
> **On a security or compliance team?** Email
> [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com) with *security* in the subject line and
> you will get a person, not a form. We will tell you exactly which public URLs this profile was
> built from so your team can see the same surface we did, and we will take the listing down on
> request while you work through it.

GRIN Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing precision therapeutics
for pediatric neurodevelopmental disorders caused by NMDA receptor dysfunction. It is an affiliate of
Neurvati Neurosciences, a Blackstone Life Sciences portfolio company. Its lead investigational asset
is radiprodil, an orally bioavailable selective negative allosteric modulator of the GluN2B subunit
of the NMDA receptor, in development for GRIN-related neurodevelopmental disorder (GRIN-NDD),
tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type II.

## API surface

**GRIN Therapeutics runs no developer program.** It publishes no product API, no developer portal, no
API documentation, no SDKs, no CLI, no MCP server, no A2A agent card, no status page and no
`/.well-known/` discovery surface. Contract discovery on 2026-08-04 probed the site root and the
`api.`, `developer.`, `docs.`, `status.`, `trust.` and `mcp.` subdomains (all NXDOMAIN), every
`/.well-known/` path (all 404), `/openapi.json`, `/swagger.json`, `/api-docs`, `/graphql` and
`/llms.txt` (all 404).

The one machine-readable surface reachable without credentials is the **WordPress REST content API**
at `https://grintherapeutics.com/wp-json` — the corporate site's own content API, not a product. It
advertises 138 routes across seven namespaces; the anonymously readable subset is modelled in
`openapi/grin-therapeutics-content-openapi.yml` (19 operations, derived from the live route index and
verified against live responses). Two things a consumer should know up front: page bodies are
WPBakery shortcode markup rather than semantic HTML, and the `posts` collection is empty — the press
releases live inside the News page, so `/feed/` carries no items.

The site also registers the WordPress Abilities API (`wp-abilities/v1`), an agent-facing capability
registry, but every route under it returns `401 rest_forbidden` to anonymous callers, so no agent
capability is exposed and none is claimed here.

## Artifacts

| Path | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `openapi/` | OpenAPI 3.1 derived from the live WordPress REST route index |
| `overlays/` | API Evangelist enhancements layered over the derived spec |
| `authentication/` | Anonymous read; application passwords and cookie+nonce gate the rest |
| `conventions/` | Pagination, field selection, embedding, caching, error envelope |
| `errors/` | Live-observed error responses (not RFC 9457) |
| `data-model/` | Entity-relationship graph across pages, media, terms and users |
| `conformance/` | Standards this surface does and does not meet |
| `lifecycle/` | Recorded absence of versioning policy, deprecation policy, SLA and status page |
| `well-known/` | Every `/.well-known/` path probed, all 404 |
| `security/` | TLS/HSTS/DNSSEC/CAA/SPF/DMARC probe results |
| `llms/` | Generated `llms.txt` for the provider |
| `skills/` | Packaged agent operating instructions for the content API |
